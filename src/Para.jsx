            <p>Symbiotes are beings from the planet Klyntar. They are all different colors and have different names. The first symbiote to go on earth was the iconic Venom who was litterally a big black spider-man but with a mouth with sharp teeth and a long tongue. When symbiotes land on earth they need to go on a host like how Venom chose Eddie Brock, and Riot chose Carlton Drake and Carnage chose Kleetus Kassidy.</p>
